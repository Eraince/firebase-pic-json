      World Overview - Who/What/When Is This World? Who: In this world, it’s not
      important to know who exactly is or will be Amy. It can be (anybody) in
      the world of the Internet. It can happen to (anybody). In this world of
      blurred self(s), Amy designs its life and lives the design until its
      personal end. The world is transforming in and out of all the selves at
      all times. Are you the people of the Internet? Welcome to (Amy)’s World.
      What: When you are in that world, it’s hard to see the world. In order to
      see that world, you have to move away from the world. It’s only after the
      liberation of billions of wage slaves in 2050, the world's residents start
      to see capitalism as it was and has been. Originated from an idea about a
      free market, capitalism capitalizes its own means to kill its own ends at
      its self-determined price of the defreedom of 5,000,000,000 people. The
      world is not better, or worse; it is, constantly, different. This fractal
      chaotic world experiences itself all the way till this very specific point
      in spacetime coordinates. If this helps you to understand just a little
      bit more about (Amy)’s world, it has changed from “males' exposed nipples
      are ok; but females’ are frowned upon” to “all nipples are ok”.
